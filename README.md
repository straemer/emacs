.emacs
=====

This is my .emacs file. The way I use it is to have it cloned in ~/Programs/emacs with a symlink targeting ~/Programs/emacs/emacs in ~/.emacs.

Some submodules are also loaded by use of the variable install-dir. If you have this installed somewhere other than ~/Programs/emacs, you'll have to edit the install-dir variable in the main file.
